# taxonomy_keys
Central location to deposit current work on keys for taxonomy; revisions, NCBI issues, etc. Then I don't have to search every repository I have for each version. 

## latest-keys
Go here for the latest versions



## Scripts 
To generate keys and lists.
Hakai-rosetta folder with workflow for rosettas. 
Older scripts largely outdated but collected here for reference when reviewing old projects.

## Species lists
latest lists

BC = lists from partners in BC, OBIS/GBIF pulls filtered to latitudes

Hakai = blast database and rosetta process
	2022rosetta > current draft is where output from scripts go, then are moved to latest-keys. Includes intermediate files, best to use latest-keys instead
	> problems: contains output from the first few scripts in the rosetta process. includes outstanding problems and conflicts currently being explored.
	> taxize : initial taxize output before merging with each other and resolved problems. separated by phylum. >> this means if only one phyla needs updated the whole database doesn't need run through taxize again
	
Fish = right now (august 2022) most lists are in scratchwork as I confirm which ones are valid/useful/not outdated. Mostly copypasted from previous projects

Fossil = 2021 extraction of BC fossils from PaleoBioDB

Invertebrates = same as fish
