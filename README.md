# taxonomy_keys
Central location to deposit current work on keys for taxonomy; revisions, NCBI issues, etc. Then I don't have to search every repository I have for each version. 

Scripts to generate keys

Species lists; latest lists in highest directory possible with date
	note; hakai folder for latest eDNA rosetta
	
references; pdfs with species lists for regions

latest-keys; dragged and dropped from relevant folders
